## Syntax

I began reading on google about sass because I wanted to see what the syntax is and more importantly, if it was similiar 
to css or could be used with html. I had found the learn sass tab and it was good but, basic. So I decided to search
on google to see if there were any easier or more effiecient ways of writing sass. I then stumbled accross some documentation on the sass-website, and it basically
gives you a cheatsheet where you can look at any topic and it will give you a whole description:

One big change from the normal css syntax is that you don't need to 
include any beginning or closing tags:
``{};``
Here's a bit of code just to see the syntax:
```
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333

body
  font: 100% $font-stack
  color: $primary-color
```

Additonally, you can have different sized headers, italics and bolded words, lists and images. Also, 
including links is really easy considering you can use either html or markdown.
