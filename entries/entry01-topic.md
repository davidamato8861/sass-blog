# Entry 1: Choosing a Topic

Choosing my topic was pretty difficult because I had some background knowledge on a few different languages.
To begin, I started looking through documentation for a few different topics on the list and knew that I needed
to try to narrow my choice down to about three or four topics in total. 

I managed to narrow my choices to three different languages:

* Active Records - Seemed really cool to try, tinker
* SASS - I knew a decent amount of css from previous projects
* Shell Scripting - Challenging but powerful
