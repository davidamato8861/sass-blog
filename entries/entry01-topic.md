## Entry 1: Choosing a Topic

Choosing my topic was pretty difficult because I had some background knowledge on a few different languages.
To begin, I started looking through documentation for a few different topics on the [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sYGyd4bthxhJ7Ap5X89Dc9YWKubw8T9lOAzvt0OIwuY/edit) and knew that I needed
to try to narrow my choice down to about three or four topics in total. 

I managed to narrow my choices to three different languages:

* **Active Record** - Seemed really cool to try, tinker
* **SASS** - I knew a decent amount of css from earlier projects
* **Shell** Scripting - Challenging but powerful

I started experimenting with Active Record because I thought that tinkering with databases would be pretty cool/unique, since we haven't done that before.
After reading about Active Record on [mherman.org](http://mherman.org/blog/2013/06/08/designing-with-class-sinatra-plus-postgresql-plus-heroku/#.WNfqH2jyvIU), I had realized that my least favorite part of the api project was when we had to work on the model.
Therefore, I moved on to Shell Scripting to see if that would be any more or less interesting. I decided to read more about Shell Scripting on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) and found that it involves
writing code on a different command line that I was not familiar with, and since there was a lot to learn, I didn't think that nine weeks is feasible to learn enough about this topic
to make even a basic program.

Furthermore, Active Record used the model of the mvc which I mostly disliked, and Shell Scripting involved writing programs in the command line, which seemed to time consuming for a nine week study.
Because of this, I was left with Sass, or Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets Sass. Before researching, I knew this topic would be a lot of fun and interesting to say the least, which led me to want to learn more about it.
On the Sass webpage, one of the reasons why developers choose Sass is because it is directly compatible with css, which is one of the languages I want to learn more about.

In conclusion, Sass is what I will be learning for the next 8 weeks. This is because it is compatible with a programming language I know, something that is interesting to learn,
and something I know that I can use in later projects.
